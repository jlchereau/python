    "Suppose we are managing the factory described in this simulation. We think that by increasing the average time until the factory halts production, we can improve profits. There are a few ways we might increase this average time. One is to increase the number of spare machines – if the number of spare machines increases, then we will have more backups before a failure brings the floor below full production. Another option is to reduce the failure rate of machines, perhaps by spending more resources on maintenance. Both of these options have costs associated with them: purchasing more machines and paying specialists to spend time maintaining the machines.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let average time to a halt in production be $H$, and suppose we estimate that our revenue is related to $H$ as $100 \\log(H)$  - the logarithm suggests diminishing returns to increasing time to halt. Furthermore, suppose we quantify the costs of maintenance as $9000(1-\\lambda)^4$ - such that our current maintenance costs are zero but reducing failure rate becomes more and more costly. Also, each new machine beyond what we have costs 175 – in other words, machine cost is $175(S_0-5)$. We can then compute profit as revenue minus costs. What combination of investment in new machines and maintenance will maximize our profit? Or are the costs of investment simply too great compared to the improvement in halting time they will result in?\n",
    "\n",
    "This code below runs through 3 different failure rates and 3 possible numbers of spare machines, and records costs, average time to halting, and profit. Each simulation configuration is run 100 times, over which an average is taken. `n_max` is set to a very high number, so that simulations do not run out of machine failures before halting. Outcomes are printed in a `DataFrame` table."
