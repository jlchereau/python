    "Now, let's put together our optimization problem piece by piece. This problem is requiring us to make binary decisions, so it is an integer program.

In this case, the company wants to minimize the maximum distance from each customer to their distribution point. \n",

If we write the distance from customer $i$ to distribution point $j$ as $d_{ij}$, and define a binary variable $x_{ij}$ to be 1 if we supply customer $i$ from distribution point $j$ and 0 otherwise, we can write the objective function as $\\max\\{d_{ij}x_{ij} \\: \\forall \\:  i \\in C, j \\in D  \\}$ - in other words, find the largest $d_{ij}x_{ij}$ over all combinations of $i$ and $j$.
