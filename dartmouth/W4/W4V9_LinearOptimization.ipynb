We first specify how this variable will be indexed: since we have $x_1$ and $x_2$, we define the variables with the index list `[1,2]`. You can define indices in `Pyomo` using many different approaches, including dictionaries and functions - for this relatively simple variable, a simple list will work well. We also specify what type of variables these are: in this case, they are real numbers greater than or equal to zero, so we specify `Domain` as `NonNegativeReals`. This takes care of the final constraint in the mathematical formulation. If we wanted to allow our variables to be negative, we could specify the `Domain` as `Reals`."
